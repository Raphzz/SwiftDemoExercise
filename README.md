# SwiftDemoExercise
Demo Project using Swift 4.2.
This is an example of mid/senior iOS position assignment. 
This is suppose to be a source of study and preparation for any iOS Dev out there interviewing for a new position.

On this exercise I try to highlight some key fundamentals which I think are important for any iOS Engineer:
- MVVM Architecture.
- TDD, Mocks and Spy Pattern.
- Use of Generics.
- No Pod or third party library whatsoever. 

# How to run:
- Have latest version of Xcode (currently 10.1).
- Clone repo.
- Open .xcodeproj file.
- Build and run it.
